This documentation was collected mainly with the goals of:
1. Provide a place for technologies that span multiple projects or are used in multiple places.
2. Document and provide advice around our current development processes.

It is hopefully straightforward where we could make it, but it covers a wide area.

Contributions and feedback are welcome!

## Projects

A short inventory and links to documentation for other IdeaCrew projects.

## Processes

This area discusses notes and advice on our working processes.

## Technologies

This area provides documentation and how-tos on our current technology stack and components we use across multiple projects.  This area is where you should look if you want to understand how to implement items using our current technology with our current conventions.

## Legacy Technologies

This area documents and helps you to understand cross-project technologies we used to implement functionality with, and may still be in use, but new development should not use.
